# SmartUni

This project aims at designing and developing a mobile application for a university which includes features suitable for both students and faculty use and with a great purpose of making university experience more convenient. This mobile application has not one but various features which the users can benefit greatly from. These features mainly include: 
1. An events calendar which keeps users informed with upcoming news and events, a scheduling system to help users in personalizing their schedules and keeping track of their schedules 
2. A chat panel to enable communication and exchange of files with other users i.e., students and faculty 
3. A navigation system which provides users with 3D simulated directions to navigate around the university, a QR code scanner in order to view information by simply scanning QR codes and an AR (augmented reality) camera that provides an immersive experience on campus.

This repository  contains the third part of the project i.e. it contains the following modules:
1. 3D Campus Navigation
2. QR Camera & Browsing
3. AR Camera

These modules are merged within one app that is created using Unity Engine.
